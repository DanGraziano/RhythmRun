# RhythmRun

## About
RhythmRun is the ultimate running companion for athletes who want to optimize their running cadence and enhance their performance. This app helps runners maintain a consistent stride through a unique metronome feature that is designed to help keep runners on track. The built-in metronome can be set based on your specific ability, with the goal for runners to build up and eventually maintain a stride rate of 180 strides per minute (spm), which is known to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of injury. RhythmRun also tracks your pace, distance, elapsed time, and running route.

This app was created by a team of graduate students for CS5520 Mobile Application Development at Northeastern University.
